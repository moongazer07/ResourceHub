Q: How do I uninstall the goose?
<br>A: Delete the Desktop Goose folder and all of its contents.

Q: Does Desktop Goose support more than one monitor?
<br>A: No, and it‚Äôs not planned at the moment. It works on one screen even if you have multiple monitors, and getting the goose to walk across screens is a whole thing.

<br>A: This is not likely to happen soon.

Q: How do I make the goose do xyz?
<br>A: Most things about the goose are configurable in the goose.ini, alternatively if you are using Desktop Goose on MacOS you can configure the goose via Desktop Goose application.

<br>A: Windows, MacOS, the next port in line is for the Samsung Smart Fridge<sup>TM</sup>.

Q: Is the goose safe to run with video games?
<br>A: It depends, the goose biting the cursor may trigger anticheats in some multiplayer games. A community-maintained safety list is hosted [here](https://desktopgooseunofficial.github.io/ResourceHub/info/GameTestList.html).

Q: How do I add custom text boxes, or images for the goose to drag?
<br>A: In the DesktopGoose folder, there is an ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù folder - Add your own text and image files to the proper Images/Memes and Text locations in there!
